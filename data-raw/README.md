hexwall
=======

The `hexwall.R` file contains one function `hexwall()`, which can be used to generate an image that neatly arranges a folder of hexagons. It makes use of the [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) library via the ROpenSci package [magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) to arrange the images.

There are several arguments allowing some control over the function's operation.

-   path: The path to a folder of hexagon stickers (png files are recommended)
-   sticker\_row\_size: The number of stickers in the longest row
-   sticker\_width: The width of each sticker in pixels
-   remove\_small: Should hexagons smaller than the sticker\_width be removed?
-   remove\_size: Should hexagons of an abnormal size be removed?
-   coords: A data.frame of coordinates defining the placement of hexagons
-   scale\_coords: Should the coordinates be scaled to the hexagon size?
-   sort\_mode: How should the files be sorted?
